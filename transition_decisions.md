# Transition Decisions & Open Questions

Running log of decisions made (and questions deferred) while executing the
`flying-shuttle-6fv` epic from `datastar_transition.md`. Nothing here blocks
work — items are resolved with a sensible default and flagged for later review.

Format: **[D]** = decision taken, **[Q]** = open question for review.

## Global

### Task .1.1 — Drop audio ingest

- **[D]** Deleted `internal/ingest/transcribe.go` (Transcriber, StubTranscriber)
  and `internal/ingest/chunker.go` (the embedding-boundary "semantic" chunker
  `ChunkSegments` + `ChunkerConfig`). Text transcripts use `ChunkTranscript`
  (~160-word greedy chunks) which is all that remains.
- **[D]** `chunker_test.go` → renamed `embed_helpers_test.go`; dropped the
  `TestChunker_*` cases, kept the CosineSimilarity / Float32s / StubEmbedder
  tests (those helpers live in `embed.go`).
- **[D]** `NewRouter` signature changed: dropped `transcriber ingest.Transcriber`
  and `chunker *ingest.Chunker`; added `clusterEmbedder ingest.Embedder` (the
  cluster-suggestion feature still needs an embedder; `main.go` passes a
  `StubEmbedder` as before).
- **[D]** `upload_handler.go`: `create` now rejects any non-text extension;
  `startProcessing` always runs the transcript path; `transcribeAsync` deleted;
  `rechunk` re-runs `ChunkTranscript`.
- **[Q]** `model.UploadStatusTranscribing` is still the "processing" status for
  text ingest — misnamed now. Left as-is to avoid a migration; rename to
  `processing` during `.2.3` or `.6.1` if we touch the upload UI copy.
- **[Q]** React `AudioUpload.tsx` still lists audio extensions in its `accept`
  filter. Harmless (backend 400s them) and the file is deleted at `.6.1`; not
  touching the React app now.


- **[D]** Working on branch `plan/datastar-transition`. Each bd task = one commit,
  committed on completion, bd issue closed with a reason.
- **[D]** The repo has a large set of pre-existing uncommitted changes (main.go,
  handlers, web/src, internal/indexer, python/). These are left untouched; only
  files each task actually needs are staged.
- **[D]** templ + Datastar work builds alongside the existing React app until the
  cutover task (`.6.1`). The Go server can serve both.
